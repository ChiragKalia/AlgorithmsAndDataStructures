# AlgorithmsAndDataStructures

In this repository, I will implement some algorithms, data structures and patterns as well.

I would try to contribute to this repo as much as I can.

Thanks.

Prerequisites 
1) Basic Concepts of C#
2) Visual Studio 


Currently I am not using test cases to test various algorithms, Which is a bad practice. Sooner, I will start writing test cases for    every algorithm I write. Thanks.
